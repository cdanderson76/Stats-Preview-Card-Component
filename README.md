This one became a much bigger challenge than I had anticipated.  I was attempting to utilize CSS Grid to put this project together (because I wanted to practice), but after dealing with additional whitespace with the photograph included with this project, I decided to switch back over to Flexbox.  After doing so, I went through the project fairly smoothly, but I couldn't get my desktop design the way that I needed it to be.  I ended up having to ditch the entire desktop solution and create another CSS file just so I could break away from any common connections with the original CSS file. Once I got the design the way that I needed it to be, I deleted the extra file and used a media query in the original.  I tried cleaning up the code as much as I could as well...
